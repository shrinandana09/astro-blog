## Introduction

Astro is a modern static site generator designed for performance and simplicity. As part of my Website Developer Internship task, I started learning Astro to understand how modern websites are built efficiently.

This blog explains my learning journey step by step.

## Why I Chose Astro

Astro focuses on sending less JavaScript to the browser. This makes websites faster and easier to maintain.

Some key reasons I liked Astro:
- File-based routing (easy navigation structure)
- Markdown support for blogs
- Component-based structure (reusable code)
- Very fast performance

## Project Setup Experience

Setting up the Astro project was my first step. I learned how to:
- Install Node.js and npm
- Create an Astro project using `npm create astro@latest`
- Run a local development server with `npm run dev`
- Fix common installation errors

This helped me understand real-world development issues.

## Working with Components

Astro uses reusable components such as:
- **Header**: Navigation at the top
- **Footer**: Information at the bottom
- **Navigation Bar**: Links to different pages

Using components helped me avoid repeating code and made the project cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Styling the Website

I used basic CSS to style the website:
- Navigation bar with active link highlighting
- Hero section on the homepage
- Card-style blog layout
- Sticky footer layout

This improved the user experience significantly and made the website look professional.

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of modern web development. Astro is beginner-friendly and powerful at the same time.

I look forward to learning more features and building advanced projects in the future.
